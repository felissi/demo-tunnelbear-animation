This demo replicated the [tunnelbear design](https://www.tunnelbear.com/account/login) I saw from [here](https://www.designspells.com/spells/bear-follows-you-as-you-type-your-email-and-covers-its-eyes-as-you-type-your), I found it very amazing. And I don't own any of the material that's used in this project, it is just for learning purpose on programming üôè.
